> ## Prerequisites
> Before you begin, you need to have completed the [Docker](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshopwhepp-lesson-docker/) lesson and have access to the CMSSW container. Mac M1/M2 chip users: most of this lesson only requires a web browser! You can read along on the lesson page for the one element that requires the CMSSW container.
