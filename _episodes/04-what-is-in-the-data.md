title: "What is in the datafiles?"
teaching: 5
exercises: 5
questions:
- "How do I inspect these files to see what is in them?"
objectives:
- "To be able to see what objects are in the data files"
- "To be able to see how big these files are and how much space these object take up."
keypoints:
- "It's useful to sometimes inspect the files before diving into the full analysis"
- "Some files may not have the information you're looking for"

This part of the lesson will be done from within the CMSSW docker container. 
All commands will be typed inside that environment. 

## Go to your CMSSW area

If you completed the lesson on [Docker](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshopwhepp-lesson-docker) you should already have a working CMSSW area, if your operating system allows.  

Restart your existing `my_od` container with:
~~~
docker start -i my_od
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Make sure you are in the `CMSSW_7_6_7/src` area; if needed change the directory:

~~~
cd /code/CMSSW_7_6_7/src
~~~
{: .language-bash}


## edmXXX tools 

CMS uses a set of homegrown tools to interact with the **AOD** format, all of which are prefixed by **edm**, which
stands for *Event Data Model*. We will not show you all of them, but introduce a few to give you an idea of what
can be done. 

### edmDumpEventContent

The **edmXXX** tools take as an argument the full path to a file. Following a similar approach
to the previous module, we've chosen one of the Monte Carlo files to test, but these commands would equally well with
a data file. 

Let's start by using `edmDumpEventContent` and looking at the options

~~~
edmDumpEventContent --help
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
Usage: edmDumpEventContent [options] templates.root
Prints out info on edm file.

Options:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  --name          print out only branch names
  --all           Print out everything: type, module, label, process, and
                  branch name
  --lfn           Force LFN2PFN translation (usually not necessary)
  --lumi          Look at 'lumi' tree
  --run           Look at 'run' tree
  --regex=REGEX   Filter results based on regex
  --skipping      Print out branches being skipped
  --forceColumns  Forces printouts to be in nice columns
~~~
{: .output}

We will first use `edmDumpEventContent` to see what is in one of these files with no other options. It may take 15-60 seconds to run and
there will be *a lot* of output. You may find it useful to redirect the output to a file and then look at it there
using `less` or a similar command (you can exit `less` by typing `q`).

{: .output}

You can get from this information the names of physics objects you may be interested in (e.g. `slimmedGenJets`)
as well as what stage of processing they were produced at (**SIM** is for simulations, **RECO** is for reconstruction and **PAT** is for MINIAOD level). 

This information can be useful when writing your analysis code, which will be discussed in a later lesson. 

Some of the other command-line options can be useful as well to filter the information. 

> ## Challenge!
> Try the following options (with the same file) and see what it gives you. Can you see why this might be useful?
