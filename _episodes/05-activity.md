Let's review some of the concepts we covered in the previous episodes. You are encouraged
to go back and engage with those episodes in order to answer these questions. 

> ## Let's review! 
> Can you get to the starting page for the CMS Open Data Portal? Can you select
> the CMS data from that page? 
{: .challenge}

> ## Let's review! 
> The bulk of the CMS released data covers what years? What was the collision
energy for those years?
{: .challenge}

> ## Let's review!
> What's the difference between *Collision* data and *Simulated* data?
{: .challenge}

> ## Let's review!
> Select the CMS *collision* data for 2015. Select only the MINIAOD data. Do you remember what the MINIAOD data are?
>
> Choose one dataset and identify different triggers that were used to direct events in this dataset. What do you think they are triggering on? 
{: .challenge}

> ## Let's review!
> Select the CMS *simulated* data for 2015. Select the **Heavy Gauge Bosons** (under *Filter by category*) and
find a *Wprime* sample. Click on it. These are 
[hypothetical gauge bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%E2%80%B2_and_Z%E2%80%B2_bosons).
>
> How can you learn *about CMS simulated dataset names*? What do you think the W' is decaying to? 
What is the assumed mass of the W' in this particular sample?
>
> How many events are in this sample? How much hard drive space does this sample occupy? Can you find the generator parameters that were used to generate the collisions?
